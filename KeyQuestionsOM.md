# 1 Introduction to Operations Management

# 2 Competitiveness, Strategy, and Productivity
* Competition is the driving force in many organizations. It may involve price, quality, special features or services, time, or other factors. To develop effective strategies for business, it is essential for organiza- tions to determine what combinations of factors are important to customers, which factors are order qualifiers, and which are order winners.
It is essential that goals and strategies be aligned with the organization’s mission. Strategies are plans for achieving organizational goals. They provide focus for decision making. Strategies must take into account present and future customer wants, as well as the organization’s strengths and weaknesses, threats and opportunities. These can run the gamut from what competitors are doing, or are likely to do, to technology, supply chain management, and e-business. Organizations generally have overall strategies that pertain to the entire organization and strategies that pertain to each of the functional areas. Func- tional strategies are narrower in scope and should be linked to overall strategies. Time-based strategies and quality-based strategies are among the most widely used strategies business organizations employ to serve their customers and to become more productive. The chapter includes a description of the Bal- anced Scorecard approach, which can be helpful for transforming strategies into actions, and the impli- cations of organization strategy for operations management.
Productivity is a measure of the use of resources. There is considerable interest in productivity both from an organizational standpoint and from a national standpoint. Business organizations want higher productivity because it yields lower costs and helps them to become more competitive. Nations want higher productivity because it makes their goods and services more attractive, offsets inflationary pres- sures associated with higher wages, and results in a higher standard of living for their people.

1.     Competitive pressure often means that business organizations must frequently assess their com- petitors’ strengths and weaknesses, as well as their own, to remain competitive.
2.     Strategy formulation is critical because strategies provide direction for the organization, so they can play a role in the success or failure of a business organization.
3.     Functional strategies and supply chain strategies need to be aligned with the goals and strategies of the overall organization.
4.     The three primary business strategies are low cost, responsiveness, and differentiation.
5.     Productivity is a key factor in the cost of goods and services. Increases in productivity can become a competitive advantage.
6.     High productivity is particularly important for organizations that have a strategy of low costs.
