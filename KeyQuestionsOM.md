# 1 Introduction to Operations Management
* The operations function in business organizations is responsible for producing goods and providing services. It is a core function of every business. Supply chains are the sequential system of suppliers and customers that begins with basic sources of inputs and ends with final customers of the system. Operations and supply chains are interdependent—one couldn’t exist without the other, and no business organization could exist without both.
* Operations management involves system design and operating decisions related to product and ser- vice design, capacity planning, process selection, location selection, work management, inventory and supply management, production planning, quality assurance, scheduling, and project management.
* The historical evolution of operations management provides interesting background information on the continuing evolution of this core business function.
* The Operations Tours and Readings included in this and subsequent chapters provide insights into actual business operations.
1. The operations function is that part of every business organization that produces products and/or delivers services.
2. Operations consists of processes that convert inputs into outputs. Failure to manage those pro- cesses effectively will have a negative impact on the organization.
3. A key goal of business organizations is to achieve an economic matching of supply and demand. The operations function is responsible for providing the supply or service capacity for expected?demand.
4. All processes exhibit variation that must be managed.
5. Although there are some basic differences between services and products that must be taken into account from a managerial standpoint, there are also many similarities between the two.
6. Environmental issues will increasingly impact operations decision making.
7. Ethical behavior is an integral part of good management practice.
8. All business organizations have, and are part of, a supply chain that must be managed.

# 2 Competitiveness, Strategy, and Productivity
* Competition is the driving force in many organizations. It may involve price, quality, special features or services, time, or other factors. To develop effective strategies for business, it is essential for organizations to determine what combinations of factors are important to customers, which factors are order qualifiers, and which are order winners. It is essential that goals and strategies be aligned with the organization’s mission.
* Strategies are plans for achieving organizational goals. They provide focus for decision making. Strategies must take into account present and future customer wants, as well as the organization’s strengths and weaknesses, threats and opportunities. These can run the gamut from what competitors are doing, or are likely to do, to technology, supply chain management, and e-business.
* Organizations generally have overall strategies that pertain to the entire organization and strategies that pertain to each of the functional areas. Functional strategies are narrower in scope and should be linked to overall strategies.
* Time-based strategies and quality-based strategies are among the most widely used strategies business organizations employ to serve their customers and to become more productive.
* The chapter includes a description of the Balanced Scorecard approach, which can be helpful for transforming strategies into actions, and the impli- cations of organization strategy for operations management.
* Productivity is a measure of the use of resources. There is considerable interest in productivity both from an organizational standpoint and from a national standpoint. Business organizations want higher productivity because it yields lower costs and helps them to become more competitive. Nations want higher productivity because it makes their goods and services more attractive, offsets inflationary pres- sures associated with higher wages, and results in a higher standard of living for their people.
* Productivity Calculation

Units produced: 	5,000 
Standard price:	$30/unit
Labor input:  	500 hours
Cost of labor:	$25/hour
Cost of materials: 	$5,000
Cost of overhead: 	2x labor cost
What is the multifactor productivity?

1.  Competitive pressure often means that business organizations must frequently assess their com- petitors’ strengths and weaknesses, as well as their own, to remain competitive.
2.  Strategy formulation is critical because strategies provide direction for the organization, so they can play a role in the success or failure of a business organization.
3.  Functional strategies and supply chain strategies need to be aligned with the goals and strategies of the overall organization.
4.  The three primary business strategies are low cost, responsiveness, and differentiation.
5.  Productivity is a key factor in the cost of goods and services. Increases in productivity can become a competitive advantage.
6.  High productivity is particularly important for organizations that have a strategy of low costs.

# 3 Product and Service Design

  *  Product and service design is a key factor in satisfying the customer. To be successful in product and service design, organizations must be continually aware of what customers want, what the competition is doing, what government regulations are, and what new technologies are available.
  *  The design process involves motivation, ideas for improvement, organizational capabilities, and fore casting. In addition to product life cycles, legal, environmental, and ethical considerations influence design choices. What degree of standardization designers should incorporate into designs is also an important consideration.
  *  A key objective for designers is to achieve a product or service design that will meet or exceed customer expectations, within cost or budget and taking into account the capabilities of operations.
  *  Although product design and service design are similar in some respects, a number of key differences exist between products and services that influence the way they are designed.
  *  Successful design often incorporates many of these basic principles: Determine what customers want as a starting point; minimize the number of parts needed to manufacture an item or the number of steps to provide a service; simplify assembly or service, standardize as much as possible; and make the design robust. Trade-off decisions are common in design, and they involve such things as development time and cost, product or service cost, special features/performance, and product or service complexity.
  *  Research and development efforts can play a significant role in product and process innovations, although these are sometimes so costly that only large companies or governments can afford to under write them.
  *  Reliability of a product or service is often a key dimension in the eyes of the customer. Measuring and improving reliability are important aspects of product and service design, although other areas of the organization also have an influence on reliability.
  *  Quality function deployment is one approach for getting customer input for product or service design.
  *  A range of factors can cause an organization to design or redesign a product or service, includ ing economic, legal, political, social, technological, and competitive pressures. Furthermore, an important cause of operations failures can be traced to faulty design. Every area of a business organization and its supply chain is connected to, and influenced by, its products and/or services, so the potential impact on each area must be taken into account when products or services are redesigned or new products or services are to be designed.
  *  Central issues relate to the actual or expected demand for a product or service, the organization’s capabilities, the cost to produce or provide, the desired quality level, and the cost and availability of necessary resources.
