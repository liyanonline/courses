# key questions

* DESCRIBE the functions, roles, and skills of managers. Give an example. 

* Present your solution to the air conditioner problem from the management perspective.

* Why can an event such as the Hawthorne studies be a major turning point in the history of management, even if the results of the studies are later shown to be in error? Discuss.Scholars generally agree that the Hawthorne Studies had a game-changing impact on management beliefs about the role of people in organizations. Mayo concluded that people’s behavior and attitudes are closely related, that group factors significantly affect individual behavior, that group standards establish individual worker output, and that money is less a factor in determining output than group standards, group attitudes, and security. These conclusions led to a new emphasis on the human behav ior factor in the management of organizations

* Aaron Alexis, a former Navy reservist who went on a shooting rampage and killed 12 people at the Washington Navy Yard in Washington, D.C., had a history of mental instability, but he was carrying a valid security clearance. How would you suggest managers make decisions for issuing or revoking security clearances to prevent this kind of catastrophe? DESCRIBE your solution with the eight steps in the decision-making process.
 *A decision is a choice. The decision-making process consists of eight steps: (1) identify the problem; (2) identify decision criteria; (3) weight the criteria; (4) develop alternatives; (5) analyze alternatives; (6) select alternative; (7) implement alternative; and (8) evaluate decision effectiveness  


* How might the cultural differences In the global dimensions affect how managers (a) use work groups, (b) develop goals/plans, (c) reward outstanding employee performance, and (d) deal with employee conflict?

* Defeating the System: Ethics at Volkswagen CASE APPLICATION 
In one of the worst business ethics scandals in history, the world learned in 2015 that Volkswagen intentionally circumvented government exhaust emission tests for years by installing so called “defeat devices” on their clean diesel vehicles.126 This revelation was a shock to many given the company’s long-standing success in the auto industry. Volkswagen, one of the world’s most recognized brands, was founded in 1937. The company is headquartered in Germany but employs more than half a million people around the world. Researchers at West Virginia University (WVU) first discovered the violation when they started studying clean diesel engines. When they tested the performance of Volkswagen vehicles, they were surprised to find that on the road emissions exceeded government allowances by almost 40 times. Further investigation by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) found that the vehicles were actually equipped with software that could essentially trick emission testing systems. The diesel engines could detect when they were being tested for emissions and changed the vehicle’s performance to improve testing results. Once on the road, the vehicle would switch out of the test mode, emitting excessive nitrogen oxide pollutants, as the WVU researchers found. The EPA’s finding covered about 500,000 cars sold in the United States only. But Volkswagen later admitted that about 11 million cars worldwide were fitted with this software. It will be a long time before Volkswagen realizes all of the damage of this ethical blunder. There will be legal sanctions from governments, private lawsuits, and consumer bans that will impact the company for a long time to come. How could such a blatant ethical violation occur? It may take years to sort out who is to blame. CEO Martin Winterkorn, who resigned in response to the scandal, initially claimed not to know about the devices. While many high-ranking executives were suspended, no one is sure who knew about or authorized the software. In fact, some believe that the driven, performance-based culture may be more to blame than any individual. Winterkorn, who reinforced the unique culture, has been described as a harddriving perfectionist who was committed to securing the top spot among global car manufacturers. He was known to criticize employees publically, and this generated both fear among employees and the commitment to do whatever necessary to ensure the company’s success. The company’s culture has been described as “confident, cutthroat, and insular.” It is possible that arrogance led Volkswagen managers to assume that U.S. government or other officials wouldn’t discover the misleading emissions tests. What’s more problematic is Volkswagen’s response to the scandal. The company first suggested a technical problem with the cars, but finally admitted the software devices were designed to cheat the system. Initially, the company reported only a limited number of cars were affected; however, as more details were uncovered, the company admitted more cars were fitted with the device and that these actions occurred over a longer period of time than originally reported. The company’s faulty initial response to the scandal has clearly made the road ahead a bigger challenge for them. In fact, a recent poll of Americans’ attitude toward 100 large companies put Volkswagen in last place.  DISCUSSION QUESTIONS 
  * 5-18. Are you surprised that an organization as large as Volkswagen was caught engaging in such unethical behavior? Do you agree that the organization’s culture could have encouraged this behavior? 
  * 5-19. Are there structural variables that may have influenced the unethical behavior at Volkswagen? 
  * 5-20. Evaluate Volkswagen’s actions based on the factors in Exhibit 5-5. How would you describe the issue intensity of Volkswagen’s actions? 
  * 5-21. Moving forward, what do you think Volkswagen needs to do to avoid such an ethical lapse in the future?

* You are a manager, and you believe that the expense reimbursement system for salespeople is far too slow, taking weeks instead of days for employees to receive their money. How would you go about convincing other managers that this problem needs to be addressed? Answer by the fowlloing theory. EXPLAIN how to manage change.
  * People resist change because of uncertainty, habit, concern over personal loss, and the belief that the change is not in the organization’s best interest. The techniques for reducing resistance to change include education and communication (educating employees about and communicating to them the need for the change), participation (allowing employees to participate in the change process), facilitation and support (giving employees the support they need to implement the change), negotiation (exchanging something of value to reduce resistance), manipulation and co-optation (using negative actions to influence), and coercion (using direct threats or force).

* Technological or process developments de-skill the global workforce. Take factory-built, flat-pack furniture—there seems to be no future for the role of an experienced carpenter. Similarly in the automobile industry, some vehicles have on-board computers that simply run a program to diagnose a problem. What will skilled mechanics employed in such industries do in the future? Many technologically advanced products, such as mobile phones, simply cannot be repaired, they are disposable. The qualified technicians’ days may be numbered. In almost every industry this trend continues to accelerate.
  * 7-11.  Is it ethical that skilled workers are being replaced in industries?
  * 7-12.  Is deskilling inevitable? Machinery has been replacing humans for some generations now. Suggest types of activities where machines do a better job.
  * 7-13.  Would you consider it a priority to save people’s jobs or would you follow this trend and automate the entire production?

* What strategic plans could the college or university at which you are taking this management course adopt to compete for students in the marketplace? Would these plans depend on the school's goals?  
  ** COMPARE and contrast approaches to goal-setting and planning.
  In traditional goal-setting, goals are set at the top of the organization and then become subgoals for each organizational area. MBO (management by objectives) is a process of setting mutually agreed-upon goals and using those goals to evaluate employee per formance. Well-written goals have six characteristics: They are (1) written in terms of outcomes, (2) measurable and quantifiable, (3) clear as to time frame, (4) challenging but attainable, (5) written down, and (6) communicated to all organizational members who need to know them. Goal-setting involves these steps: review the organization's mission; evaluate available resources; determine the goals individually or with input from others; write down the goals and communicate them to all who need to know them; and review results and change goals as needed. The contingency factors that affect planning include the manager’s level in the organization, the degree of environ mental uncertainty, and the length of future commitments. The two main approaches to planning include the traditional approach, which has plans developed by top man agers that flow down through other organizational levels and which may use a formal planning department. The other approach is to involve more organizational members in the planning process.
